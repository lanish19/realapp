# Enhanced Municipal Data Sources Integration

This document outlines how the newly collected municipal and specialized data sources will be integrated into the comprehensive guide.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Expand Source Directory Section**
   - Replace the current limited municipal listings with comprehensive county-by-county directory
   - Add specialized data sources section with detailed descriptions
   - Organize by geographic region and data type

2. **Update Data Collection Methods**
   - Add specific instructions for accessing each municipal database type
   - Include screenshots or step-by-step processes for major platforms (AxisGIS, etc.)
   - Create standardized data extraction templates

3. **Create Regional Subsections**
   - Develop specific guidance for each Eastern Massachusetts subregion
   - Highlight unique data sources and access methods by area
   - Address regional variations in data availability

4. **Add Cross-Reference Tables**
   - Create lookup tables matching municipalities to available data types
   - Develop data source comparison matrix
   - Build decision trees for selecting optimal sources by need

## Key Enhancements

1. **Comprehensive Municipal Coverage**
   - All 175+ Eastern Massachusetts municipalities now included
   - Standardized link format for assessor, GIS, and building department resources
   - Verification of link functionality and data availability

2. **Specialized Data Sources**
   - Addition of 40+ specialized data sources beyond basic municipal records
   - Categorization by provider type and data specialty
   - Evaluation of free vs. paid features

3. **Regional Planning Resources**
