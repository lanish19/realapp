export const enhancedComparableSalesFlow = ai.defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'enhancedComparableSalesFlow',
    inputSchema: ComparableSalesInputSchema,
    outputSchema: ComparableSalesOutputSchema,
  },
  async (input: ComparableSalesInput, flowContext?: any) => {
    try {
      // Stage 1: LLM generates search parameters
      const searchParams = await generateSearchParameters(input);
      
      // Stage 2: Database lookup using parameters
      const databaseResults = await queryMultipleDataSources(searchParams);
